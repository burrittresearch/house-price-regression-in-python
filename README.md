# house-price-regression-in-python
This notebook includes coding and notes for predicting California house prices using multiple and polynomial regression in python.

## Highlights

* Successfully trained, tested and deployed California house price machine learning model in python using multiple and polynomial regression algorithms.

* Acheived an r2 score of 0.5912 using both multiple and polynomial regression on the highest performing features. 

* While the model is not as accurate as expected it compares favorably with an r2 score of 6.110 for the entire training set using the same features.

* Visualized feature performance with correlation heatmaps and pairplots.

* Created custom function to visualize selected dataframes, features, and plot layout.

* Visualized results for all models.

* Deployed the model on fictional housing data.
